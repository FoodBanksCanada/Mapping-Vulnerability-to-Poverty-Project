                change. However, even when comprehensive data is available, it is not always easily accessible for the general public. The intent of this map is facilitate greater accessibility of publically available data from Statistics Canada, making visible key indicators that show which areas across Canada are vulnerable to poverty and hunger. It is also hoped that this map will enable and facilitate conversations between civil society, government and other interested parties about how best to address poverty and hunger in their communities.</p>

                could potentially be used to identify households. Access to data from the territories is limited. Food security data
                collected from the Canada Community Health Survey was excluded because it is not available at the Federal Electoral

Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income.<br>For the 2016 Census, the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.<br>The low-income concepts are not applied in the territories and in certain areas based on census subdivision type (such
                        as Indian reserves). The existence of substantial in-kind transfers (such as subsidized housing and First Nations band
                        housing) and sizeable barter economies or consumption from own production (such as product from hunting, farming or
                        fishing) could make the interpretation of low-income statistics more difficult in these situations.<br>Low-income measure, after tax (LIM-AT) - The Low-income measure, after tax, refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of
                        median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence
                        scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a
                        household's needs increase, but at a decreasing rate, as the number of members increases.<br>Using data from the 2016 Census of Population, the line applicable to a household is defined as half the Canadian median
                        of the adjusted household after-tax income multiplied by the square root of household size. The median is determined
                        based on all persons in private households where low-income concepts are applicable. Thresholds for specific household
                        sizes are presented in Table 4.2 Low-income measures thresholds (LIM-AT and LIM-BT) for private households of Canada,
                        2015, Dictionary, Census of Population, 2016.<br>When the unadjusted after-tax income of household pertaining to a person falls below the threshold applicable to the
                        person based on household size, the person is considered to be in low income according to LIM-AT. Since the LIM-AT
                        threshold and household income are unique within each household, low-income status based on LIM-AT can also be reported
                        for households.<br>Prevalence of low income - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified low-income line.</td>

                        in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is
                        2016, while household total income is reported for the year 2015. As well, for some households, the 2015 household total

Not all of these organizations could be mapped because of errors in or unavailability of postal codes. Of the organizations and food banks listed on the map, some are “hubs” which distribute food to community agencies like food pantries, shelters, and after school programs that rely on food to deliver their support. Others food banks are serve people directly, and some food banks do both. On the map, in many cases only the locations of the “hubs” are provided, even though their membership includes food banks and other programs in their areas. This is the case for larger cities like Vancouver and Toronto. When those organizations that are not listed on the map are included, there are approximately 5000. Points were approximated based on food bank postal codes and are not intended for navigational purposes.</td>
