# Food Banks Canada's Mapping Vulnerability to Poverty Project

This project was created to enable the consumption and understanding of data related to poverty vulnerability across Canada.  You can visit the map [here](http://www.map.foodbankscanada.ca).

Access to data has become more important than ever. Not only is data important for evidenced based policy making, but also to inform the general public by making important information visible. In either case, data can be a catalyst for change. However, even when comprehensive data is available, it is not always easily accessible for the general public. The intent of this map is facilitate greater accessibility of publically available data from Statistics Canada, making visible key indicators that show which areas across Canada are vulnerable to poverty and hunger. It is also hoped that this map will enable and facilitate conversations between civil society, government and other interested parties about how best to address poverty and hunger in their communities.

This project was created to enable the consumption and understanding of data related to poverty vulnerability across Canada.  The project is shared here with the hope that it will benefit the eradication of poverty as much as possible.

## Methodolody & Data
Source information and data notes are available [here](http://www.map.foodbankscanada.ca/about.hml#data)

Census data was retrieved from Statistics Canada and processed to gather only relevant variables for selected geographies using PostgeSQL.  Spatial and tabular data was joined in QGIS before exporting layers to geojson.  Due to the size of the data and a desire to use feature state within Mapbox-GL-JS, data was built into vector tilesets using [tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe).

The data classification process began by evaluating natural breaks (Jenks) in the data as well as quantile classification. This was followed by manual adjustments to have similar classes between geographies for clear comparisons and to minimize distortion of data.
